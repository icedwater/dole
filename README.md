# Developing Operationally: Learning Experience (DOLE)

Here on the DOLE, we make sure that poor starving software practitioners get a
fair shot at life! We assume that developing software is already a known skill
and we allow for best practices or fanciful ideas to take flight.

While some of this might look like DevOps stuff, it is not just that, so it is
still very much subject to change. Some of the crazy ideas and fancy practices
already "in the pipeline" include:

 - Docker
 - Openshift
 - Debian Packaging
 - Continuous Integration with GitLab
 - Gitpitch
 - OpenDocument

## Translation

This is my collection of random notes and tools as I learn the above topics. I
am always open to suggestions for improvement, so feel free to create an issue
and let me know what you think.
